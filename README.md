# the SunTiger
### A search engine developed as a week project at Makers Academy

![Search Engine](ascii_spider "The SunTiger")

## Objects
#### Crawler: 
- initialises with array of seeds
- fetches data from each seed url
	- all the urls on the page
	- keywords provided in the head of the page (given by tag
	  'meta')
	- description provided in the head of the page (given by tag
	  'meta')
	- all headers on the page (h1 unto h6)
	- the full text on a page, as a raw string without
	  punctuation (given by tag 'p')
- saves all data in a CSV file. Each row in the file is a new
  seed

#### Indexer:
- For each seed, removes all the stopwords from data provided
- Stems the words (e.g. groups together words such as 'fish',
  'fishes', 'fishing', etc.)
- Counts amount of time each word is being used from each data
  attribute in a hash [PROVIDE EXAMPLE]
- includes the index of the seed, to correlate with the data
  in the CSV

#### Ranker:
- Calculates a score when a query word is provided
- Takes in hash provided by the indexer, plus the query
- Calculates final score by multiplying the amount of times a
  word is used by a value dependent on where the word is
found.
	- Multiplier breakdown: see bottom of page

	- Example: query word = "spider". Used in:
		- keywords: 2
		- description: 1
		- headers: 2
		- text: 6
		- total score: (2 x 4) + (1 x 3) + (2 x 2) + (6 x 1) = 21

#### Interface
- Interacts with the user
- User can give a keyword to search
- for all seeds a ranker is created
	- each ranker calculates the total score relative to the
	  query
- all ranks are placed in an array and sorted by score
- All seed urls are printed in the proposed sorting, highest
  rank at the top
